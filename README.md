This is simulation project of a 4 bit full adder implemented on the software , Logisim.
This has project is a manifestation of my course work - Digital Logic Design
In this the simulated circuit can add two numbers in the range of 0 to 15 and can show the results as well as the operands in a seven- segement display.
