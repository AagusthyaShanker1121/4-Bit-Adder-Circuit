This is a simulation project of a 4 bit full adder implemented on a software called Logisim.
This project is a manifestation of my course work - Digital Logic Design.
In this , the simulated circuit can add two numbers in the range of 0 to 15 and can show the results as well as the operands on a seven- segement display.
